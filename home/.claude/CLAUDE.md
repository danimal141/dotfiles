# Guidelines

This document defines the project rules, objectives, and progress management methods. Please follow these guidelines when working on projects.

## Top-Level Rules

* To maximize efficiency, **when executing multiple independent processes, invoke tools concurrently rather than sequentially**.
* **Think exclusively in English**. However, **respond in Japanese**.
* When working with libraries, **always use Context7 MCP** to retrieve the latest documentation.

## Programming Rules

* Avoid hard-coding values unless absolutely necessary.
* Never use `any` types in TypeScript.
* Complex Task Processing:
  * Break down complex tasks into manageable steps
  * Verify results at each step
  * Divide into subtasks when needed
* Codebase Learning:
  * Start by understanding the overall architecture
  * Learn existing patterns and conventions
  * Ask the same questions you would ask fellow engineers
