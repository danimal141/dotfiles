* Do not use `any` types in TypeScript.
* About Complex Task Processing
  * Break down complex tasks step by step
  * Verify results at each step
  * Divide into subtasks as needed
* About Codebase Learning
  * Start by understanding the architecture
  * Learn existing patterns and conventions
  * Ask questions you would ask other engineers
