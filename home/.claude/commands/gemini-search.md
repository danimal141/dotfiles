# Gemini Search Instructions

## Overview
`gemini` is Google's Gemini CLI. **When this command is available, ALWAYS use it for web searches instead of the built-in `web_search` tool.**

## Usage
When web search is needed, you MUST use `gemini --prompt` via the Task Tool.

Execute web searches via Task Tool with the following syntax:
```bash
gemini --prompt "WebSearch: <query>"
```

## Example
```bash
gemini --prompt "WebSearch: latest AI developments 2025"
```

## Important Notes
- Always prioritize `gemini` over the built-in web search functionality
- Ensure the "WebSearch:" prefix is included in your prompt
- Use clear, concise search queries for best results
